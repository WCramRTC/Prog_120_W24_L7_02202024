This transcription covers a programming lecture, primarily focused on various programming concepts and demonstrations in C#. Here are the key points summarized with relevant code snippets:

1. **Introduction to Methods:**
   - Methods are likened to variables but for blocks of code, allowing for code reusability and organization. The structure for declaring a method was shown:
     ```csharp
     public static void MethodName()
     {
         // Code block
     }
     ```

2. **Method with Parameters:**
   - Demonstrated how methods can take parameters to become more dynamic and reusable. An example method that displays names was used to illustrate this concept:
     ```csharp
     public static void DisplayNames(string name)
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Your name is " + name);
     }
     ```

3. **Method with Return Type:**
   - Explained how methods can return values, making them even more powerful. An example method for adding two numbers and returning the result was provided:
     ```csharp
     public static int AddTwoNumbers(int num1, int num2)
     {
         return num1 + num2;
     }
     ```

4. **Introduction to Loops:**
   - Loops were introduced as a means to repeat code blocks based on a condition. Specifically, the `while` loop was discussed:
     ```csharp
     while(condition)
     {
         // Code to repeat
     }
     ```

5. **Practical Loop Example:**
   - A practical example was given, demonstrating how a `while` loop could be used to print a sequence of numbers from a start to an end point, including incrementing a counter within the loop:
     ```csharp
     int start = 0, end = 5;
     while(start < end)
     {
         Console.WriteLine(start);
         start++;
     }
     ```

6. **Using Loops for Mathematical Calculations:**
   - Showed how loops can be utilized for mathematical purposes, such as calculating the sum of a range of numbers and determining the average:
     ```csharp
     int sum = 0, count = 0;
     while(start <= end)
     {
         sum += start;
         start++;
         count++;
     }
     double average = (double)sum / count;
     Console.WriteLine("Average: " + average);
     ```

7. **Interactive Loop with User Input:**
   - An interactive loop example was provided, where the loop continues based on user input (e.g., pressing 'E' to exit the loop):
     ```csharp
     string userInput;
     do
     {
         Console.WriteLine("Hi, Adam");
         Console.WriteLine("Press E to exit");
         userInput = Console.ReadLine();
     } while(userInput != "E");
     ```

8. **Loop with Condition Based on User Input:**
   - Demonstrated a loop that runs until a condition based on user input is met, showcasing how to dynamically change the loop's behavior:
     ```csharp
     bool isRunning = true;
     while(isRunning)
     {
         // Loop code
         if(userInput == "E")
         {
             isRunning = false;
         }
     }
     ```

This transcription encapsulates the essence of a programming lecture, focusing on methods, loops, and practical examples of these concepts in C#.
